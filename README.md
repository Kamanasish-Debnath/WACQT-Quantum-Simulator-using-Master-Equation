This code can be used to simulate a quantum algorithm using the native gates available at Chalmers.

"Chalmers_Simulator_mesolve.py" is imported as "import Chalmers_Simulator as CS" and the developed functionalities can be used.

Quantum gates modelled so far-
a) Single qubit gates- Hadamard, Pauli X, Pauli Y and virtual Pauli Z
b) Entangling gate - Controlled Z gate

Under construction-
a) iSWAP entangling gate
b) Three qubit Controlled CZS gate.
