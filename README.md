This code can be used to simulate a quantum algorithm using the native gates available at Chalmers. <br>
Please refer to the example folder for more details. <br>

"Chalmers_Simulator_mesolve.py" is imported as "import Chalmers_Simulator as CS" and the developed functionalities can be used.

Quantum gates modelled so far-
a) Single qubit gates- Hadamard, Pauli X, Pauli Y and virtual Pauli Z <br>
b) Two qubit entangling gate - Controlled Z gate <br>
(c) Three qubit entangling gate - Controlled CZS gate

Under construction- <br>
a) iSWAP entangling gate
